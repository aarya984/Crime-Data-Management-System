The Crime Data Management System is a SQL-based project designed to effectively manage and organize crime-related information. It provides a structured database to track crimes, suspects, witnesses, evidence, and police officers. This project simulates a real-world crime tracking system, demonstrating how data can be stored and linked for efficient retrieval and management.  

The database includes realistic Indian names and scenarios, making it relatable and practical. It showcases the use of relational database concepts such as foreign keys, indexing, and structured queries. This project is ideal for learning database design or as a foundation for building a more advanced crime management application.  

Key features include crime tracking, suspect and witness management, evidence storage, and officer assignments. Additionally, users can generate reports, such as open cases or officers linked to specific crimes, by running SQL queries.  

This project demonstrates the importance of database relationships and organization for solving real-world problems.
